## Installation

### Claude Desktop

To add the Context7 MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration, you'll need to modify your Claude Desktop configuration file.

#### Configuration

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@context7/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration File Locations

The Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Claude Code

For Claude Code users, you can easily add the Context7 MCP server using the built-in MCP management command:

```shell
claude mcp add --transport sse context7 https://mcp.context7.com/sse
```

This command will automatically configure the Context7 MCP server for use with Claude Code.

### VS Code

For VS Code users, you can add the Context7 MCP server to GitHub Copilot by adding this configuration to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "context7": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Context7 MCP server will automatically provide Claude with access to:

- Complete Jumppad documentation
- Resource configuration examples
- Best practices and patterns
- Latest updates and changes

When asking Claude about Jumppad-related topics, it will automatically query the Context7 server to provide the most accurate and current information.

## Project Configuration

The Context7 server uses the `context7.json` configuration file in the repository root to understand the project structure and documentation scope. This file defines which folders and file types to include when providing context about Jumppad.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Context7 MCP server:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Verify the configuration file path is correct for your operating system
3. Restart Claude Desktop after making configuration changes
4. Check that the `context7.json` file exists in your project repository
