# Overview

<Intro>
Jumppad is controlled via a very easy to use command-line interface (CLI). Jumppad is only a single command-line application: `jumppad`, which takes a subcommand such as `up` or `status`. The complete list of subcommands is in the navigation to the left.

## Help

The Jumppad CLI is a well-behaved command line application. In erroneous cases, a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to `-h` and `--help` as you would most likely expect.

To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run Jumppad with no arguments. To get help for any specific subcommand, run the subcommand with the `-h` argument.

Each command has been conveniently documented on this website. Links to each command can be found on the left.

## Autocomplete

Jumppad's CLI supports command autocomplete. Autocomplete can be installed or uninstalled by running the following on bash, zsh or fish shells:

```shell
jumppad completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]
```

<CodeGroup title="Loading completions for your shell.">
```bash {{ title: "bash" }}
source <(yourprogram completion bash)

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
# Linux:
jumppad completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/jumppad

# macOS:
jumppad completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/jumppad
```

```zsh {{ title: "zsh" }}
# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
# you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
jumppad completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_jumppad"

# You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
# I also had to disable oh-my-zsh calls in ~/.zshrc
```

```zsh {{ title: "oh-my-zsh" }}
# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
# you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

# Install the completion code for jumppad into the oh-my-zsh completion folder
jumppad completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_shipyard
```

```shell {{ title: "fish" }}
jumppad completion fish | source

# To load completions for each session, execute once:
jumppad completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/jumppad.fish
```

```powershell {{ title: "powershell" }}
jumppad completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

# To load completions for every new session, run:
jumppad completion powershell > jumppad.ps1
# and source this file from your PowerShell profile.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Environment variables

Jumppad can use environment variables to configure command-line tool options. These environment variables can be overridden as needed using individual flags.

<Properties>
  <Property name="LOG_LEVEL" type="string" value="info">
    Set the log level for the jumppad command to either `debug`, `info`, `warning` or `error`.
