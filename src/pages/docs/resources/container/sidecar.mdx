# Sidecar `sidecar`

<Intro>
The Sidecar resource allows you to run associated processes for Containers.
Sidecar does not have its own network, a Sidecar resource shares the network 
with the target container. For example, localhost in the sidecar is localhost 
in the `container`.

Sidecar resources are not routable in the same way as container resources are. 
You can not map an ingress to a sidecar and a sidecar can not expose ports. 
Traffic which is destined for a process running in a sidecar must be sent 
to the target container.
</Intro>

## Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="target" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The id of a container to attach the sidecar to.

    ```hcl
      resource.container.mine.meta.id
    ```
  </Property>

  <Property name="image" type="#image" required="true" value="">
    Image defines a Docker image to use when creating the container.
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="entrypoint" type="[]string" required="false" value="">

    entrypoint defined in the Docker image.        
  </Property>

  <Property name="command" type="[]string" required="false" value="">
    Command allows you to specify a command to execute when starting a container. 
    Command is specified as an array of strings, each part of the command is a separate string. 
    
    For example, to start a container and follow logs at /dev/null the following command could be used.

    ```hcl
    command = [
        "tail",
        "-f",
        "/dev/null"
    ]
    ```

  </Property>

  <Property name="port_range" type="#port_range" required="false" value="">
    A port_range stanza allows you to expose a range of container ports on the local network or host. This stanza can be specified multiple times.

    The following example would create 11 ports from 80 to 90 (inclusive) and expose them to the host machine.

    ```hcl
      port {

          success_codes = [200]
        }
        
        tcp {

    ```

    Images are cached in the local Docker engine using the following convention.

    ```shell
      jumppad.dev/localcache/<resource_name>:latest
    ```

    Once cached images are not rebuild with every `run` to force the update of an image you can use the `--force-update` flag with `run`.

    ```shell
      jumppad up --force-update ./build
    ```
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="fqrn" type="string" required="false" value="" readonly>
    Fully qualified resource name for the container, this value can be used to

    ```
  </Property>

## health_check

A health_check stanza allows the definition of a health check which must pass before 
the container is marked as successfully created. There are three different types 
of healthcheck `http`, `tcp`, and `exec`, these are not mutually exclusive, it is
possible to define more than one health check.

Health checks are executed sequentially, if one health check fails, the following 
checks are not executed. The execution order is `http`, `tcp`, `exec.


```hcl
  health_check {
    timeout = "30s"
    http {
      address = "http://localhost:8500/v1/status/leader"
      success_codes = [200]
    }
    
    http {
      address = "http://localhost:8500/v1"
      success_codes = [200]
    }
    
    tcp {
      address = "localhost:8500"
    }
    
   exec {
      script = <<-EOF
        #!/bin/bash

        curl "http://localhost:9090"
      EOF
    }
  }
```

<Properties>
  <Property name="timeout" type="duration" required="true" value="">
    The maximum duration to wait before marking the health check as failed. Expressed as a Go duration, e.g. `1s` = 1 second, `100ms` = 100 milliseconds.
  </Property>
  <Property name="http" type="#http_health_check" required="false" value="">
    HTTP Health Check block defining the address to check and expected status codes.

    Can be specified more than once.
  </Property>
  <Property name="tcp" type="#tpc_health_check" required="false" value="">
    TCP Health Check block defining the address to test.

    Can be specified more than once.
  </Property>
  <Property name="exec" type="#exec_health_check" required="false" value="">
    Exec Health Check block defining either a command to run in the current container,
    or a script to execute.

    Can be specified more than once.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## http_health_check

A HTTP health check executes a HTTP GET request for the given address and evaluates
the response against the expected `success_codes`. If the reponse matches any of
the given codes the check passes.

```hcl
http {
  address = "http://localhost:8500/v1/status/leader"
  method  = "GET"
  body    = <<-EOF
    {"test": "123"}
  EOF
  headers = {
    "X-Auth-Token": ["abc123"]
  }
  success_codes = [200]
}
```

<Properties>
  <Property name="address" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The URL to check, health check expects a HTTP status code to be returned by the URL in order to pass the health check. 
  </Property>
  <Property name="method" type="string" required="false" value="GET">
    HTTP method to use when executing the check 
  </Property>
  <Property name="body" type="string" required="false" value="">
    HTTP body to send with the request
  </Property>
  <Property name="body" type="string" required="false" value="">
    HTTP body to send with the request
  </Property>
  <Property name="headers" type="map[string][string]" required="false" value="">
    HTTP headers to send with the check
  </Property>
  <Property name="success_codes" type="[]number" required="false" value="200">
    HTTP status codes returned from the endpoint when called. If the returned status code matches any in the array then the health check will pass.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## tcp_health_check

A TCP health check attempts to open a connection to the given address. If a
connection can be opened then the check passes.

```hcl
tcp {
  address = "localhost:8500"
}
```

<Properties>
  <Property name="address" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The adress to check.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## exec_health_check

Exec health checks allow you to execute a command or script in the current container.
If the command or script receives an exit code `0` the check passes.

<Properties>
  <Property name="command" type="[]string" required="false" value="">
    A command to execute.

        #!/bin/bash
        
        FILE=/etc/resolv.conf
        if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
