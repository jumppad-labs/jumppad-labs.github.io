# Variable `variable`

<Intro>
The `variable` resource allows you to create modular and reusable configuration. 
Variables are defined using variable resouce, they allow the author of a blueprint 
to provide default values which can be overriden my the following methods:

* Variable definition files
* Flags provided to Jumppad up
* Environment variables

Any variable defined is local to the current module. 
</Intro>

## Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="value" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The value of the variable.

    <b>Note:</b> Variables are processed before resources and can not contain any interpolated
    values.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Examples

### Simple Variables
The following eample defines two variables version which has a value 1.6.1,
and subnet which has a value of 10.6.0.0/16. To use these variables inside
the configuration you use the `variable.[variable_name]` syntax. When using a variable 
on its own it is not required to encapsulate this in a string, as can be seen
in the subnet example subnet = var.subnet, however; should you need to concatonate
this variable with another then you need to encapsulate the `variable.[variable_name]`
inside the parentheses `${}`, this is seen in the container image stanza, 
`name = "consul:${variable.version}"`.


```hcl
variable "version" {
  default = "1.6.1"
}

variable "subnet`" {
  default = "10.6.0.0/16"
}

resource "network" "onprem" {
  subnet = variable.subnet
}

resource "container" "consul" {
  image   {
    name = "consul:${variable.version}"
  }

  command = ["consul", "agent", "-dev"]

  network   {
    id = resource.network.onprem.resource_id
    ip_address = "10.6.0.200"
  }
}
```

### Complex Example

In addition to specifying simple string variables, it is also possible to define 
variables which are maps, or arrays. The following example shows the use of both 
of these types. In addition to the example shown below, a map can also contain 
an array and an array a map allowing you to mix complex types together.

```hcl
variable "subnet" {
  default = {
    main = "10.6.0.0/16"
    consul = "10.7.0.0/16"
  }
}

variable "command" {
  default = [
    "consul",
    "agent",
    "-dev"
  ]
}

resource "network" "onprem" {
  subnet = variable.subnet.main
}

resource "container" "consul" {
  command = variable.command
}
```

## Overriding Variables

The `variable` resource allows the specification of a default value for a variable,
overriding these variables can be performed using the three following methods:

### Variable Files

When reading a configuration folder Jumppad will auotmatically search for and 
parse files with the extension .vars. Variable files allow you to set the value 
for complex and simple variables and are specified as seen in the following example:

```hcl
version = "1.8.1"

subnet = {
  main = "192.1.0.0/16"
  consul = "192.2.0.0/16"
}
```

In addition to variable files being automatically loaded by Jumppad from the 
module folder you can specify external files using the command line flag `--vars-file`. 
There is no naming convention for variable files specified in this way.

```shell
jumppad up --vars-file="./myvariables.defaults" ./module 
```

### Command Line Arguments

It is possible to override variables using command line arguments, the run and
test commands have the flag --var which has a value variable=value pair that can
be used to set a varaible. The --var flag can be specified multiple times.

```shell
jumppad up --var="version=1.9.1" --var="another=value" ./module 
```

### Environment Variables

Lastly you can specify variables using environment variables. To define a variable
using an environment variable you prefix the name of the variable with `HCL_VAR_`, 
for example, the variable version when set as an environment variable would 
be specified as `HCL_VAR_version`.

```shell
export SY_VAR_version=1.8.2
```

### Variable Load order

When using variables there is a defined order of precidence. The following list shows the priority order for setting varaibles.

* variable stanza block
* `[name].vars` files found in the config folder
* environment variables `HCL_VAR_[name]`
* command line argumens specified with the `--var` flag
* variable files specified using the `--var-file` command line flag
