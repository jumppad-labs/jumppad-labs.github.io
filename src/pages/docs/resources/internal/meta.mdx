# Meta Properties

<Intro>
In addition to resource specific properties, all jumppad resources have the
following properties.
</Intro>

<Properties>
  <Property name="depends_on" type="[]string" required="false" value="">
    An array of resources that this resource depends on. Jumppad will ensure that
    all resources referenced in `depends_on` are created before the resource. 

    For example, the resource "mine" would be created after the resource "myother".

    ```hcl
      resource "container" "mine" {
        depends_on = ["resource.container.myother"]
      }
      
      resource "container" "myother" {

      }
    ```

    Where possible Jumppad attempts to automatically create a dependency graph
    by using interpolated properties. For example, the previous scenario could 
    have been written without using `depends_on` by using interpolated properties. 

    ```hcl
      resource "container" "mine" {
        image {
          name = resource.container.myother.image.name
        }
      }
      
      resource "container" "myother" {
        image {
          name = "myimage:version"
        }
      }
    ```
  </Property>

  <Property name="disabled" type="bool" required="false" value="false">
    If set to false the resource will not be created.
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="meta" type="#meta" required="false" value="">
    Metadata regarding the resource.
  </Property>
  </Properties>

### meta
<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string" required="false" value="" readonly>
    The unique `id` for the resource, this value can be used in interpolation
    syntax to reference properties for a resource.

    ```
      resource.container.nic
      ouput.myoutput
      module.mine.submodule.resource.container.nic
      module.mine.submodule.ouput.myoutput
    ```
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="name" type="string" required="false" value="" readonly>
    The name of the resource, *note:* this value is not unique and does not
    take into account if the resource is embedded in a module.

    This value is the same as the `name` field of the resource. i.e "mine".

    ```hcl
      resource "container" "mine" {}
    ```
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="type" type="string" required="true" value="" readonly>
    The string type of the resource.
    
    This value is the same as the `type` field of the resource. i.e. "container"

    ```hcl
      resource "container" "mine" {}
    ```
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="module" type="string" required="false" value="" readonly>
    The full module path for the resource. Should the resource be included 
    in a module, this value will be the name of the module and any parent 
    modules that the resource is embedded in.

    For example, given the following structure, the `module` value would be
    "mymodule.mysubmodule".

    ```hcl
      resource "container" "mine" {}

      ## included in

      module "mysubmodule" {}
      
      ## included in

      module "mymodule" {}
    ```
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="file" type="string" required="false" value="" readonly>
    The absolute path of the file that contains this resource
  </Property>
