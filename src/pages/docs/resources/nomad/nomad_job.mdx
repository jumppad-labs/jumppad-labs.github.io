# Nomad Job `nomad_job`

<Intro>
The `nomad_job` resource allows you to apply one or more Nomad job files to
a cluster.

Jumppad monitors changes to the jobs defined in the `paths` property and 
automatically recreates this resource when `jumppad up` is called.
</Intro>

## Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="cluster" type="nomad_cluster" required="true" value="">
    The reference to a cluster to apply the jobs to. Nomad jobs
    are only applied when the referenced cluster is created and healthy.

    ```hcl
      resource "nomad_job" "example" {
        cluster = resource.nomad_cluster.dev
        ...
      }
    ```
  </Property>
  <Property name="paths" type="[]string" required="true" value="">
    Paths to the Nomad job files to apply to the cluster.
  </Property>

  <Property name="health_check" type="#health_check" required="false" value="">
    Optional health check to perform after the jobs have been applied, this resource
    will not complete until the health checks are passing.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## health_check

A health_check stanza allows the definition of a health check which must pass before the resource is marked as successfully created.

```hcl
health_check {
  timeout = "60s"
  jobs = ["example"]
}
```

<Properties>
  <Property name="timeout" type="duration" required="true" value="">
    The maximum duration to wait before marking the health check as failed. 
    Expressed as a Go duration, e.g. `1s` = 1 second, `100ms` = 100 milliseconds.
  </Property>

  <Property name="jobs" type="[]string" required="true" value="">
    An array of nomad jobs that must be marked as "Running" by the Nomad
    server.
  </Property>
</Properties>
