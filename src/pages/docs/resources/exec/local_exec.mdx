# Local Exec

<Intro>
The `local_exec` resource allows the execution of arbitrary commands and scripts 
on the local machine. The command runs in the local user space, and has access 
to all the environment variables that the user executing jumppad run has access 
too. Additional environment variables, and the working directory for the command 
can be specified as part of the resource.

Log files for exec_local are written to $HOME\.jumppad\logs\[name].log

Documentation is work in progress, please see the old documentation at:

## Examples

### Minimal Example

The following example will run the command consul services register ./config/redis/hcl 
and will wait for it to complete. If the command takes longer than 30s to complete, 
it will be automatically killed.

```hcl
resource "local_exec" "exec_standalone" {
  command = [
    "consul"
    "services",
    "register",
    "./config/redis.hcl"
  ]

  environment = {
    CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR = "http://consul.container.local.jmpd.in:8500"
  }

  timeout = "30s"
}
```

### Daemon Mode
The following example runs the command consul agent -dev and immediately returns 
leaving the command to run as a daemon which is not terminated when the jumppad 
up command completes.

Daemons either exit on their own or are killed when running jumppad down.

```hcl
resource remote_exec "exec_standalone" {
  command = [
    "consul"
    "agent",
    "-dev",
  ]

  daemon = true
}
```
